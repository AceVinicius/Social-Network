 * @brief Contains the operations of the friend's tree
 *
 * The binary search tree (a.k.a. BST) is a data structure used to store
 * data and find elements faster than arrays, where the search is made
 * element by element. In a BST, the left subtree always have smaller
 * values (the field used to organize the tree, in our case the id) than
 * the root and the right subtree always have greater values which gives
 * us a O(log n) search in average, where 'n' is the number of nodes in
 * tree. With this in mind, all the operations used to manipulate this
 * data structure are in this file.
 * 
 * Functions in this file:
 *   @see FL_createNewNode()
 *   @see FL_insert()
 *   @see FL_delete()
 *   @see FL_findMinimum()
 *   @see FL_search()
 *   @see FL_free()

/**
 * @brief Insert an element in the BST.
 *
 * In a BST we always insert the element in the root (if the tree is empty) or
 * in a leaf (if have at least one node). So, we start checking if current node
 * is a a leaf (in both cases, it will be equals to NULL, being a leaf or an 
 * empty tree), if it is, we return calling for FL_createNewNode. If it isn't 
 * we compares the current @p id with the id of the current node (tree->id).
 * 
 * If it's greater we call:
 * @code
 * tree->right = FL_insert( tree->right, 123 );
 * @endcode
 * 
 * If it's smaller we call:
 * @code
 * tree->left = FL_insert( tree->left, 123 ).
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @code
 * root = FL_insert( root, 123 );
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @param tree Is a pointer to the root of the tree where the new element will 
 *             be inserted.
 * @param id   Is the key that will be used to place the node inside the BST.
 * 
 * @return Returns the address of the position where the new_FL_node was inserted.
 * 
 * @see FL_allocateNewNode()
 * 
 * @note This is a recursive function. It calls itself for find the correct
 *       place to insert the node.

/**
 * @brief Removes an element in the BST.
 *
 * In a BST we can't just remove the element in the tree. First, we check if the tree is
 * empty. If it's not, then we look for the node to be deleted. When we find we have
 * three things to check, if it's a leaf, if have one child or two children. In the 
 * first case, we can just free the node. In the second case assign the pointer from
 * the root to the child. In the third case, it's a bit more complicated. We have to
 * find the smallest node in the right subtree, assign it to the node we want to delete,
 * and call FL_delete to the node we found with the smallest value. Doing this, we 
 * simplify our complexity of case three to a case one or two, because if it's the
 * smallest in the subtree, it has no left subtree.
 * 
 * @code
 * FL_delete( root, 123 );
 * @endcode

 * @param tree Is a pointer to the root of the tree where the element will be
 *             removed.
 * @param id   Is the key that will be used to find the node inside the BST to be
 *             removed.
 * 
 * @return Returns the address of the position where the node was removed. Returns
 *         NULL if the node was not found.
 * 
 * @see FL_findMinimum()
 * 
 * @note This is a recursive function. It calls itself to simplify the problem
 *       if the desired node has two children.
